This sample projects demonstrates video playback in Android using a retained `Fragment` rather than an `Activity` that handles configuration changes manually.  The resulting experience is identical to how the YouTube app handles rotation during video playback.  In other words, the video does not need to be paused, rebuffered, or reloaded, and does not skip or drop any audio frames when the device orientation changes.

This implementation uses a `TextureView` and its accompaning `SurfaceTexture` to dump video frames to.  A `SurfaceTexture` uses a GL texture object (referenced by an integer from the GL context).  Thus, I believe it's okay to retain a reference to a SurfaceTexture through configuration changes.  The TextureView itself is destroyed and recreated during the configuration change (along with the backing `Activity`) and the newly created `TextureView` is simply update with the `SurfaceTexture` reference before it is attached.
